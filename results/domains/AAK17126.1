ASN_GLYCOSYLATION
PS00001
N-glycosylation site.
N[^P][ST][^P]

************************
* N-glycosylation site *
************************

It has been known for a long time [1] that potential N-glycosylation sites are
specific to the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr.  It must be noted that the
presence of the consensus  tripeptide  is  not sufficient  to conclude that an
asparagine residue is glycosylated, due to  the fact that the  folding of  the
protein plays an important  role in the  regulation of N-glycosylation [2]. It
has been shown [3] that  the  presence of proline between Asn and Ser/Thr will
inhibit N-glycosylation;  this has been confirmed by a statistical analysis of
glycosylation sites  [4],  which  also  shows that about 50% of the sites that
have a proline C-terminal to Ser/Thr are not glycosylated.

It must also  be noted that there  are  a few  reported cases of glycosylation
sites with the pattern Asn-Xaa-Cys; an  experimentally demonstrated occurrence
of such a non-standard site is found in the plasma protein C [5].

CAMP_PHOSPHO_SITE
PS00004
cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site.
[RK]{2}.[ST]

****************************************************************
* cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site *
****************************************************************

There has been a  number of studies  relative to the  specificity of cAMP- and
cGMP-dependent protein kinases [1,2,3].  Both types of kinases appear to share
a preference  for  the  phosphorylation  of serine or threonine residues found
close to at least  two consecutive N-terminal  basic residues. It is important
to note that there are quite a number of exceptions to this rule.

PKC_PHOSPHO_SITE
PS00005
Protein kinase C phosphorylation site.
[ST].[RK]

*****************************************
* Protein kinase C phosphorylation site *
*****************************************

In vivo, protein kinase C  exhibits  a  preference  for the phosphorylation of
serine or  threonine residues found close to a C-terminal basic residue [1,2].
The presence  of  additional   basic residues at the  N- or C-terminal of  the
target amino acid enhances the Vmax and Km of the phosphorylation reaction.

CK2_PHOSPHO_SITE
PS00006
Casein kinase II phosphorylation site.
[ST].{2}[DE]

*****************************************
* Casein kinase II phosphorylation site *
*****************************************

Casein kinase II (CK-2) is a protein serine/threonine kinase whose activity is
independent of  cyclic  nucleotides   and  calcium.  CK-2  phosphorylates many
different proteins.   The  substrate  specificity [1]  of  this  enzyme can be
summarized as follows:

 (1) Under comparable conditions Ser is favored over Thr.
 (2) An acidic residue (either Asp or Glu) must be present three residues from
     the C-terminal of the phosphate acceptor site.
 (3) Additional acidic  residues in  positions +1, +2, +4, and +5 increase the
     phosphorylation rate.  Most  physiological  substrates  have at least one
     acidic residue in these positions.
 (4) Asp is preferred to Glu as the provider of acidic determinants.
 (5) A basic residue at the N-terminal  of the  acceptor  site  decreases  the
     phosphorylation rate, while an acidic one will increase it.

TYR_PHOSPHO_SITE_1
PS00007
Tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site 1.
[RK].{2}[DE].{3}Y

*****************************************
* Tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites *
*****************************************

Substrates of tyrosine protein kinases are generally characterized by a lysine
or an arginine seven residues  to  the N-terminal side  of  the phosphorylated
tyrosine.  An acidic residue (Asp  or Glu) is often  found at either  three or
four residues to  the N-terminal side  of  the tyrosine  [1,2,3].  There are a
number of exceptions to  this rule such as the  tyrosine phosphorylation sites
of enolase and lipocortin II.

We developed  two  signature  patterns for the tyrosine kinase phosphorylation
sites. The  first  pattern  is  directed  against  the  sites where the acidic
residue (Asp  or Glu) is found at three residues to the N-terminal side of the
tyrosine, and the second one against the site where it is at four.

MYRISTYL
PS00008
N-myristoylation site.
G[^EDRKHPFYW].{2}[STAGCN][^P]

*************************
* N-myristoylation site *
*************************

An  appreciable  number of eukaryotic  proteins  are  acylated by the covalent
addition of myristate (a C14-saturated fatty acid) to their N-terminal residue
via an amide linkage [1,2]. The sequence specificity of the enzyme responsible
for this  modification,   myristoyl CoA:protein N-myristoyl transferase (NMT),
has been  derived from the sequence of known N-myristoylated proteins and from
studies using synthetic peptides. It seems to be the following:

 - The N-terminal residue must be glycine.
 - In position 2, uncharged residues  are allowed.  Charged residues,  proline
   and large hydrophobic residues are not allowed.
 - In positions 3 and 4, most, if not all, residues are allowed.
 - In position  5,  small uncharged  residues are allowed (Ala, Ser, Thr, Cys,
   Asn and Gly). Serine is favored.
 - In position 6, proline is not allowed.

-Consensus pattern: G-{EDRKHPFYW}-x(2)-[STAGCN]-{P}
                    [G is the N-myristoylation site]

-Note: We  deliberately include as  potential myristoylated  glycine residues,
 those which  are  internal  to a sequence. It could well be that the sequence
 under study  represents  a  viral  polyprotein  precursor and that subsequent
 proteolytic processing  could expose an internal glycine as the N-terminal of
 a mature protein.

ATP_GTP_A
PS00017
ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop).
[AG].{4}GK[ST]

*****************************************
* ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop) *
*****************************************

From sequence comparisons and crystallographic data analysis it has been shown
[1,2,3,4,5,6] that an appreciable proportion of proteins that  bind ATP or GTP
share a number of more or less conserved sequence motifs.   The best conserved
of these  motifs  is  a  glycine-rich region, which typically forms a flexible
loop between a beta-strand and an alpha-helix. This loop interacts with one of
the phosphate  groups  of  the  nucleotide.   This sequence motif is generally
referred to as the 'A' consensus sequence [1] or the 'P-loop' [5].

There are numerous ATP- or GTP-binding proteins  in which the P-loop is found.
We list below  a number of protein  families  for  which  the relevance of the
presence of such motif has been noted:

 - ATP synthase alpha and beta subunits (see <PDOC00137>).
 - Myosin heavy chains.
 - Kinesin heavy chains and kinesin-like proteins (see <PDOC00343>).
 - Dynamins and dynamin-like proteins (see <PDOC00362>).
 - Guanylate kinase (see <PDOC00670>).
 - Thymidine kinase (see <PDOC00524>).
 - Thymidylate kinase (see <PDOC01034>).
 - Shikimate kinase (see <PDOC00868>).
 - Nitrogenase iron protein family (nifH/chlL) (see <PDOC00580>).
 - ATP-binding proteins involved  in 'active transport' (ABC transporters) [7]
   (see <PDOC00185>).
 - DNA and RNA helicases [8,9,10].
 - GTP-binding elongation factors (EF-Tu, EF-1alpha, EF-G, EF-2, etc.).
 - Ras family of GTP-binding proteins (Ras, Rho, Rab, Ral, Ypt1, SEC4, etc.).
 - Nuclear protein ran (see <PDOC00859>).
 - ADP-ribosylation factors family (see <PDOC00781>).
 - Bacterial dnaA protein (see <PDOC00771>).
 - Bacterial recA protein (see <PDOC00131>).
 - Bacterial recF protein (see <PDOC00539>).
 - Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins alpha subunits (Gi, Gs, Gt, G0, etc.).
 - DNA mismatch repair proteins mutS family (See <PDOC00388>).
 - Bacterial type II secretion system protein E (see <PDOC00567>).

Not all ATP- or GTP-binding proteins are picked-up by this motif.  A number of
proteins escape detection because the structure   of their ATP-binding site is
completely different from that of the P-loop.  Examples  of  such proteins are
the E1-E2 ATPases or  the  glycolytic kinases.   In  other ATP- or GTP-binding
proteins the flexible loop exists  in a  slightly different form; this is  the
case for tubulins or protein kinases.  A special mention must  be reserved for
adenylate  kinase,  in  which  there  is a  single  deviation  from the P-loop
pattern: in the last position Gly is found instead of Ser or Thr.

-Consensus pattern: [AG]-x(4)-G-K-[ST]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: a majority.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: in addition to the proteins  listed
 above,  the 'A' motif is also  found in a number  of other proteins.  Most of
 these proteins  probably  bind  a nucleotide, but others are definitively not
 ATP- or GTP-binding (as for example  chymotrypsin,  or  human  ferritin light
 chain).
