ASN_GLYCOSYLATION
PDOC00001
N-glycosylation site.
N[^P][ST][^P]

************************
* N-glycosylation site *
************************

It has been known for a long time [1] that potential N-glycosylation sites are
specific to the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr.  It must be noted that the
presence of the consensus  tripeptide  is  not sufficient  to conclude that an
asparagine residue is glycosylated, due to  the fact that the  folding of  the
protein plays an important  role in the  regulation of N-glycosylation [2]. It
has been shown [3] that  the  presence of proline between Asn and Ser/Thr will
inhibit N-glycosylation;  this has been confirmed by a statistical analysis of
glycosylation sites  [4],  which  also  shows that about 50% of the sites that
have a proline C-terminal to Ser/Thr are not glycosylated.

It must also  be noted that there  are  a few  reported cases of glycosylation
sites with the pattern Asn-Xaa-Cys; an  experimentally demonstrated occurrence
of such a non-standard site is found in the plasma protein C [5].

PKC_PHOSPHO_SITE
PDOC00005
Protein kinase C phosphorylation site.
[ST].[RK]

*****************************************
* Protein kinase C phosphorylation site *
*****************************************

In vivo, protein kinase C  exhibits  a  preference  for the phosphorylation of
serine or  threonine residues found close to a C-terminal basic residue [1,2].
The presence  of  additional   basic residues at the  N- or C-terminal of  the
target amino acid enhances the Vmax and Km of the phosphorylation reaction.

CK2_PHOSPHO_SITE
PDOC00006
Casein kinase II phosphorylation site.
[ST].{2}[DE]

*****************************************
* Casein kinase II phosphorylation site *
*****************************************

Casein kinase II (CK-2) is a protein serine/threonine kinase whose activity is
independent of  cyclic  nucleotides   and  calcium.  CK-2  phosphorylates many
different proteins.   The  substrate  specificity [1]  of  this  enzyme can be
summarized as follows:

 (1) Under comparable conditions Ser is favored over Thr.
 (2) An acidic residue (either Asp or Glu) must be present three residues from
     the C-terminal of the phosphate acceptor site.
 (3) Additional acidic  residues in  positions +1, +2, +4, and +5 increase the
     phosphorylation rate.  Most  physiological  substrates  have at least one
     acidic residue in these positions.
 (4) Asp is preferred to Glu as the provider of acidic determinants.
 (5) A basic residue at the N-terminal  of the  acceptor  site  decreases  the
     phosphorylation rate, while an acidic one will increase it.

-Consensus pattern: [ST]-x(2)-[DE]
                    [S or T is the phosphorylation site]

-Note: This pattern is found in most of the known physiological substrates.

MYRISTYL
PDOC00008
N-myristoylation site.
G[^EDRKHPFYW].{2}[STAGCN][^P]

*************************
* N-myristoylation site *
*************************

An  appreciable  number of eukaryotic  proteins  are  acylated by the covalent
addition of myristate (a C14-saturated fatty acid) to their N-terminal residue
via an amide linkage [1,2]. The sequence specificity of the enzyme responsible
for this  modification,   myristoyl CoA:protein N-myristoyl transferase (NMT),
has been  derived from the sequence of known N-myristoylated proteins and from
studies using synthetic peptides. It seems to be the following:

 - The N-terminal residue must be glycine.
 - In position 2, uncharged residues  are allowed.  Charged residues,  proline
   and large hydrophobic residues are not allowed.
 - In positions 3 and 4, most, if not all, residues are allowed.
 - In position  5,  small uncharged  residues are allowed (Ala, Ser, Thr, Cys,
   Asn and Gly). Serine is favored.
 - In position 6, proline is not allowed.

-Consensus pattern: G-{EDRKHPFYW}-x(2)-[STAGCN]-{P}
                    [G is the N-myristoylation site]

-Note: We  deliberately include as  potential myristoylated  glycine residues,
 those which  are  internal  to a sequence. It could well be that the sequence
 under study  represents  a  viral  polyprotein  precursor and that subsequent
 proteolytic processing  could expose an internal glycine as the N-terminal of
 a mature protein.
