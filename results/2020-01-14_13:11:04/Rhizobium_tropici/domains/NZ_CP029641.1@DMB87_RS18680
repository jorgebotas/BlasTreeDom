ASN_GLYCOSYLATION
PDOC00001
N-glycosylation site.
N[^P][ST][^P]

************************
* N-glycosylation site *
************************

It has been known for a long time [1] that potential N-glycosylation sites are
specific to the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr.  It must be noted that the
presence of the consensus  tripeptide  is  not sufficient  to conclude that an
asparagine residue is glycosylated, due to  the fact that the  folding of  the
protein plays an important  role in the  regulation of N-glycosylation [2]. It
has been shown [3] that  the  presence of proline between Asn and Ser/Thr will
inhibit N-glycosylation;  this has been confirmed by a statistical analysis of
glycosylation sites  [4],  which  also  shows that about 50% of the sites that
have a proline C-terminal to Ser/Thr are not glycosylated.

It must also  be noted that there  are  a few  reported cases of glycosylation
sites with the pattern Asn-Xaa-Cys; an  experimentally demonstrated occurrence
of such a non-standard site is found in the plasma protein C [5].

CK2_PHOSPHO_SITE
PDOC00006
Casein kinase II phosphorylation site.
[ST].{2}[DE]

*****************************************
* Casein kinase II phosphorylation site *
*****************************************

Casein kinase II (CK-2) is a protein serine/threonine kinase whose activity is
independent of  cyclic  nucleotides   and  calcium.  CK-2  phosphorylates many
different proteins.   The  substrate  specificity [1]  of  this  enzyme can be
summarized as follows:

 (1) Under comparable conditions Ser is favored over Thr.
 (2) An acidic residue (either Asp or Glu) must be present three residues from
     the C-terminal of the phosphate acceptor site.
 (3) Additional acidic  residues in  positions +1, +2, +4, and +5 increase the
     phosphorylation rate.  Most  physiological  substrates  have at least one
     acidic residue in these positions.
 (4) Asp is preferred to Glu as the provider of acidic determinants.
 (5) A basic residue at the N-terminal  of the  acceptor  site  decreases  the
     phosphorylation rate, while an acidic one will increase it.

-Consensus pattern: [ST]-x(2)-[DE]
                    [S or T is the phosphorylation site]

-Note: This pattern is found in most of the known physiological substrates.

AMIDATION
PDOC00009
Amidation site.
.G[RK][RK]

******************
* Amidation site *
******************

The precursor of  hormones  and other active  peptides  which are C-terminally
amidated is always directly followed [1,2] by a glycine residue which provides
the amide group, and  most often by at  least two  consecutive  basic residues
(Arg or Lys) which generally function as an active peptide  precursor cleavage
site.  Although all amino acids can be amidated,  neutral hydrophobic residues
such as Val or Phe are good substrates, while  charged residues such as Asp or
Arg  are much less reactive.  C-terminal  amidation has not  yet been shown to
occur in unicellular organisms or in plants.
