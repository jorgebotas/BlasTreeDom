cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site.

****************************************************************
* cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site *
****************************************************************

There has been a  number of studies  relative to the  specificity of cAMP- and
cGMP-dependent protein kinases [1,2,3].  Both types of kinases appear to share
a preference  for  the  phosphorylation  of serine or threonine residues found
close to at least  two consecutive N-terminal  basic residues. It is important
to note that there are quite a number of exceptions to this rule.

PKC_PHOSPHO_SITE

Protein kinase C phosphorylation site.
[ST].[RK]

*****************************************
* Protein kinase C phosphorylation site *
*****************************************

In vivo, protein kinase C  exhibits  a  preference  for the phosphorylation of
serine or  threonine residues found close to a C-terminal basic residue [1,2].
The presence  of  additional   basic residues at the  N- or C-terminal of  the
target amino acid enhances the Vmax and Km of the phosphorylation reaction.

CK2_PHOSPHO_SITE
PDOC00006
Casein kinase II phosphorylation site.
[ST].{2}[DE]

*****************************************
* Casein kinase II phosphorylation site *
*****************************************

Casein kinase II (CK-2) is a protein serine/threonine kinase whose activity is
independent of  cyclic  nucleotides   and  calcium.  CK-2  phosphorylates many
different proteins.   The  substrate  specificity [1]  of  this  enzyme can be
summarized as follows:

 (1) Under comparable conditions Ser is favored over Thr.
 (2) An acidic residue (either Asp or Glu) must be present three residues from
     the C-terminal of the phosphate acceptor site.
 (3) Additional acidic  residues in  positions +1, +2, +4, and +5 increase the
     phosphorylation rate.  Most  physiological  substrates  have at least one
     acidic residue in these positions.
 (4) Asp is preferred to Glu as the provider of acidic determinants.
 (5) A basic residue at the N-terminal  of the  acceptor  site  decreases  the
     phosphorylation rate, while an acidic one will increase it.

-Consensus pattern: [ST]-x(2)-[DE]
                    [S or T is the phosphorylation site]

-Note: This pattern is found in most of the known physiological substrates.

MYRISTYL
PDOC00008
N-myristoylation site.
G[^EDRKHPFYW].{2}[STAGCN][^P]

*************************
* N-myristoylation site *
*************************

An  appreciable  number of eukaryotic  proteins  are  acylated by the covalent
addition of myristate (a C14-saturated fatty acid) to their N-terminal residue
via an amide linkage [1,2]. The sequence specificity of the enzyme responsible
for this  modification,   myristoyl CoA:protein N-myristoyl transferase (NMT),
has been  derived from the sequence of known N-myristoylated proteins and from
studies using synthetic peptides. It seems to be the following:

 - The N-terminal residue must be glycine.
 - In position 2, uncharged residues  are allowed.  Charged residues,  proline
   and large hydrophobic residues are not allowed.
 - In positions 3 and 4, most, if not all, residues are allowed.
 - In position  5,  small uncharged  residues are allowed (Ala, Ser, Thr, Cys,
   Asn and Gly). Serine is favored.
 - In position 6, proline is not allowed.

-Consensus pattern: G-{EDRKHPFYW}-x(2)-[STAGCN]-{P}
                    [G is the N-myristoylation site]

-Note: We  deliberately include as  potential myristoylated  glycine residues,
 those which  are  internal  to a sequence. It could well be that the sequence
 under study  represents  a  viral  polyprotein  precursor and that subsequent
 proteolytic processing  could expose an internal glycine as the N-terminal of
 a mature protein.
